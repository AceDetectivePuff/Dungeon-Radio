# [Dungeon-Radio](https://team-hufflepuff.github.io/Dungeon-Radio/)
A page full of Spotify Embeds for use with Kenku FM.

These carefully curated Spotify playlists come from [/u/highway1024](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/qzy7tk/50_carefully_curated_spotify_playlists_for_rpg/) on Reddit! You can go [here](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4NLZReAYD7sht8YtA2Sg8K?si=UNIMqDSUSAeroi5JMshgYA) to check out their music on Spotify too.

I primarily made this page to be used in conjunction with [KenkuFM for Discord](https://www.kenku.fm). I highly recommend checking them out if you run online games or use an Elgato Stream Deck.
